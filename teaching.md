Each semester, I teach the course [Data Science for Energy System
Modelling](https://fneum.github.io/data-science-for-esm) at [TU
Berlin](https://tu.berlin).

The course follows a hands-on practical approach with programming assignments
throughout the course. The students work with real data on historical weather,
land eligibility constraints for renewable development, existing power plant
fleets, transmission network data, electricity markets, and demand time series
for modelling energy systems.

The teaching material is freely available online at
[fneum.github.io/data-science-for-esm](https://fneum.github.io/data-science-for-esm).
