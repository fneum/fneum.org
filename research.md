### Hydrogen Strategies

A continental hydrogen network could significantly impact Europe's energy
transition. A network, mostly repurposing gas pipelines, could cut costs by
3.4%, especially when electricity grid expansion is limited. While expanding
both networks yields the highest savings, a net-zero system is achievable
without either -- at a 10% premium -- revealing flexibility in future energy
infrastructure design.

### Import Strategies

Imports of renewable energy or green steel into Europe could reduce system costs
by 1-14%. Methanol, steel, and hydrogen by pipeline emerge as preferred import
vectors over electrity, with diminishing returns for larger volumes. However,
retaining some domestic power-to-X production benefits renewable integration.
The study highlights the need for coordination between Europe's import and
infrastructure strategy to create a resilient and cost-effective pathway to
net-zero.

### Carbon Management Strategies

A CO<sub>2</sub> pipeline network could enhance European carbon management by
connecting point-source capture to geological sequestration and utilization
sites for synthetic fuel and feedstock production. The study demonstrates how
carbon infrastructure interacts with hydrogen networks, renewables deployment,
industry decarbonization approaches, and biomass usage.

### Modelling-to-Generate Alternatives (MGA)

Many energy system studies provide single optimal solutions, potentially
overlooking viable cost-effective alternatives. This line of research applies
modeling-to-generate-alternatives to uncover diverse near-optimal configurations
for Europe's renewable power system. Exploring the decision space beyond
least-cost solutions offers a more comprehensive view of possible clean energy
futures, aiding robust infrastructure planning and consensus-building where
public acceptance is limited.

### Prices in 100% Renewable Electricity Markets

This study explores price formation mechanisms in fully renewable electricity
markets where traditional fuel costs no longer drive pricing. Using a stylized
model with wind, solar, batteries and hydrogen storage, it demonstrates how
demand elasticity and storage bidding interact to produce stable pricing. Even
modest demand elasticity of -5% significantly smooths price duration curves,
reducing zero-price hours from 90% to 30% and providing more consistent revenues
across 70 weather years.

### Multi-Decadal Weather Variability

This study examines how 60 years of historical weather data impacts the design
of Europe's future sector-coupled energy system. Findings reveal that robust
system designs, capable of withstanding compound weather events, require
strategic backup generation and transmission infrastructure. The study
highlights the importance of considering long-term weather patterns in energy
planning to ensure resource adequacy and emissions goals are met in highly
renewable systems.
