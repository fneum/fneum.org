I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Digital Transformation in
Energy Systems](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ensys) at the [Technische Universit√§t
Berlin (TUB)](https://www.tu.berlin/en), focussing on resilient energy
infrastructure planning for systems with high shares of variable renewable
electricity. My research supports strategic decision-making to accelerate the
transition to a climate-neutral energy system by mid-century, devising
strategies for European hydrogen infrastructure, green energy imports, and
carbon management while exploring alternative future energy system and market
designs.

Before moving to Berlin, I received my PhD in computer science at the [Institute
for Automation and Applied Informatics](https://www.iai.kit.edu/) at the
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu), focussing on
computational and near-optimal trade-offs in renewable power system modelling.

I studied sustainable energy systems at the [University of
Edinburgh](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/msc-taught/msc-sustainable-energy-systems)
(MSc) and industrial engineering and economics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology](https://www.wiwi.kit.edu/english/studiengangWiingBSc.php) (BSc). I
also briefly worked at [Fraunhofer ISI](https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/).

I am an ally of the [openmod initiative](http://openmod-initiative.org/), which
promotes openness and transparency in energy system research. I also develop and
co-maintain open-source software:

- [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA) is a energy system modelling framework written in Python,
- [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-Eur) is a workflow to build a model
  of the European sector-coupled energy system,
- [atlite](https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite) is a Python package to convert weather data to energy systems data.

I appreciate clear data visualization that makes complex information easier to understand.
